# News_category_classifier_model
Hello Data Science Aspirants, I hope you all are doing good and learning well, So this repository about News Category classification.
From the beginning, since the first printed newspaper, every news that makes into a
page has had a specific section allotted to it. Although pretty much everything changed in
newspapers from the ink to the type of paper used, this proper categorization of news was
carried over by generations and even to the digital versions of the newspaper. Newspaper
articles are not limited to a few topics or subjects, it covers a wide range of interests from
politics to sports to movies and so on. For long, this process of sectioning was done manually
by people but now technology can do it without much effort. In this project, Data Science,
Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques are used to predict which
genre or category a piece of news will fall in to from the story. It is a classification problem.

**Tools Used**
1. Python Programming
2. Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab
3. Pandas
4. Numpy
5. Matplotlib
6. Seaborn
7. Exploratory Data Analysis
8. Data Visualization
9. Sci-kit learn
10. Natural Language Processing

**Future Scope**
See, we have lot of news applications and websites, in that we can see news is
categorized in different sections like cinema, politics, entertainment, technology etc. In future
this model will help to use in categorize the sections.
